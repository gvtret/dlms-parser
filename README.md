# dlms-parser
================{}

A DLMS/COSEM parser written in Python üöÄ
-----------------------------------------

### Project Purpose and Background

The dlms-parser project is designed to parse DLMS and COSEM messages. DLMS (Device Language Message Specification) is a protocol used for communication between devices in various industries. COSEM (Common Object Security Environment) is a specification for secure communication over a network. This project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to process and analyze DLMS and COSEM messages, enabling developers to create applications that integrate with DLMS/COSEM devices.

### Features and Functionality

* Parse DLMS and COSEM messages
* Support for multiple message types
* Built-in support for common DLMS and COSEM objects
* Highly configurable and customizable

### Technology Stack

* Language: Python 3.x
* Dependencies: None (since no package.json found)

### Installation and Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Then, simply clone the repository and run the following commands:

1. `python setup.py install` üõ†Ô∏è
2. `python app.py` üîß

### Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the parser:

```python
import dlms

# Create a new parser instance
parser = dlms.Parser()

# Load a message from a file
message = parser.load_message('example.dlm')

# Print the message contents
print(message)
```

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following directories and files:

* `dlms`: The core parser logic
* `app`: A sample application that illustrates how to use the parser
* `setup.py`: The setup script for installing the parser
* `__init__.py`: A special file that makes the `dlms` directory a Python package
