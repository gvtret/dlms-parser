# dlms-parser
================{}

A DLMS/COSEM parser written in Python üöÄ
-----------------------------------------

### Project Purpose and Background

The dlms-parser project is designed to parse DLMS and COSEM messages. DLMS (Device Language Message Specification) is a protocol used for communication between devices in various industries. COSEM (Common Object Security Environment) is a specification for secure communication over a network. This project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to process and analyze DLMS and COSEM messages, enabling developers to create applications that integrate with DLMS/COSEM devices.

### Features and Functionality

* Parse DLMS and COSEM messages
* Support for multiple message types
* Built-in support for common DLMS and COSEM objects
* Highly configurable and customizable

Note: This project is currently under active development, and some features or components might be incomplete or subject to change.

### Technology Stack

* Language: Python 3.x
* Dependencies:
    * `PyQt5>=5.15` (for the GUI application)
    * Python 3.8+ required

### Installation and Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. Then, simply clone the repository and run the following commands:

1. `python setup.py install` üõ†Ô∏è
2. `python app.py` üîß (To run the example GUI application)

### Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use a decoder (assuming you have raw byte data):

```python
# Example: Using the BER decoder. Adjust import and usage as per actual class names and methods.
from core.decoders.ber import BERDecoder # Example, adjust as per actual class names

# Create a new decoder instance
# Ensure BERDecoder is the correct class name and it's available at this path.
# You might also import directly from the package if installed, e.g., from dlms_parser.core.decoders.ber import BERDecoder
decoder = BERDecoder() # Example instantiation

# Example byte data (replace with your actual data)
hex_data = "0102030405" # Example hex string
byte_data = bytes.fromhex(hex_data)

# Decode the byte data
# The actual method name might be different (e.g., decode_frame, parse)
try:
    decoded_data, _ = decoder.decode(byte_data) # Assuming decode returns a tuple
    # Print the decoded data (structure will depend on the decoder's output)
    print(decoded_data)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during decoding: {e}")

```

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following directories and files:

* `core`: Contains the core parsing and decoding logic.
* `app.py`: A sample GUI application that illustrates how to use the decoders.
* `setup.py`: The setup script for installing the parser.
* `dlms_parser/__init__.py`: Initializes the `dlms_parser` package.
* `tests`: Contains tests for the parsers and decoders.
